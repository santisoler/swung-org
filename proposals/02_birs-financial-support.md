## Abstract

<!-- Briefly describe the proposal in up to four sentences. Provide some -->
<!-- justification for it. Focus on the outcomes for Swung's members. **This -->
<!-- may be the only part that some people read.** -->

The proposal is for Software Underground to provide financial support to
participants of the upcoming [BIRS](https://www.birs.ca) Workshop "Open-source
tools to enable geophysical data processing and inversion".
During this event, the communities of Fatiando a Terra and SimPEG will gather
to work and plan the future development of open-source tools in geophysics.

The financial support would be aimed to cover travel and per diem costs of
participants that cannot count on any additional funding sources, or won't be
able to attend without it.
Participants belonging to underrepresented groups within geosciences will be
prioritized with the goal of increasing the diversity within participants.


## Motivation and scope

<!-- Provide some background and context for the proposal. What provoked the need -->
<!-- for the change, action, or technology you're proposing? -->

The authors of this proposal are organizing a two days workshop at the Banff
International Research Station (BIRS), happening from July 28 to July 30, 2023,
in Banff, Canada.
During this workshop, the communities of users and developers of Fatiando
a Terra and SimPEG will gather to work on developing a fully open-source
geophysical workflow that covers processing raw data to producing interpretable
models; improving the interoperability and usability of our tools; and
nurturing community building, increasing diversity and sustainability whiten
these projects.

BIRS' organization will provide the venue where the event will take place, and
cover in-person participants' accommodation for two nights, inside BIRS campus.
Nevertheless, participants will have to gather their own funds to cover
travelling and food costs.

In the spirit of increasing the diversity within these two communities, we
would like to provide financial support to participants that might encounter
difficulties ensuring the fundings to cover the costs of attending the
workshop.
Participants that identify themselves as members of an underrepresented group
within geosciences and STEM will be prioritized to receive financial support.

The goals of this workshop are very aligned with the ones of Software
Underground. We consider this will be a very valuable event for the Fatiando
and SimPEG projects, and for the broader geoscientific community.


## Detailed description

<!-- This is the meat of the proposal. Describe what you're proposing in at -->
<!-- least a couple of paragraphs. Use subsections (use `### Subhead` if you -->
<!-- need to. Include relevant links or data tables using Markdown. -->

In this proposal we would like to ask Software Underground for financial
support to cover some portion of the participant's travel and food costs during
the aforementioned Workshop.

Travel costs will include any expense that participants might have to afford in
order to travel from their current residency to BIRS facilities through an
direct route. They include flight tickets, ferry tickets and ground
transportation expenses (transit, gas usage). It doesn't include expenses
related to vehicle renting.
Food costs will include all food expenses that the participant will have to
afford during the days of the workshop, and during the travel days.

Participants will be considered as *candidates* for getting financial support
if they meet the following criteria:
1. they confirm their **in-person** attendance to the workshop;
2. lack of third-party funding sources to **partially** or **totally** cover
   these expenses; and
3. they **express the need** for financial support from event organizers.

Candidates that identify themselves as members of underrepresented groups in
geosciences and/or STEM will be prioritized for receiving financial aid.

Candidates that get selected to receive financial aid will be considered
*beneficiaries*.

In addition, event organizers will designate a portion of the financial support
to _swag_ expenses, such as stickers, T-shirts and/or customized notebooks.
These will include logos and content related to Software Underground, Fatiando
a Terra, SimPEG and other related communities and projects within geosciences.


## Cost

<!-- Provide some relevant financial background. Exactly what you need to -->
<!-- show here depends on the specific proposal. But try to anticipate questions -->
<!-- the board might have. For example: -->
<!---->
<!-- * What does Swung currently spend on trying to solve this problem? -->
<!-- * What would your proposal cost in the near term (e.g. for a small experiment)? -->
<!-- * What might it cost in the medium term (e.g. in the first year of operation)? -->
<!-- * Break costs down into capital cost, operating cost, and labour cost (or time). -->
<!-- * Use USD or EUR please. -->
<!-- * If you can only provide estimates, give ranges. -->

### Food costs

Considering that most of the food expenses will take place during the event,
we'll use the prices of [meals offered by
BIRS](https://www.birs.ca/frequently-asked-questions#Meals) as a guide to
estimate food costs per participant.

| Meal | Cost (CAD) | USD (1.35 CAD[^2]) |
|------|------------|----------------|
| Breakfast | 18.43 | 13.61 |
| Lunch | 22.15 | 16.35 |
| Dinner | 29.42 | 21.72 |
| **Total per day** | **70.0** | **51.68** |

This adds up to **51.68 USD** of food expense per day per beneficiary.

### Travel costs

Travel costs will be estimated after building a list of candidates and
reviewing their financial needs and travel costs.


### Total costs

TBD


## Implementation

<!-- How exactly would Software Underground go about implementing your proposal? -->
<!---->
<!-- Again, think about the near-term, e.g. for a proof-of-concept, and the longer -->
<!-- term, e.g. for a full implementation. Think about your own role in the -->
<!-- implementation. -->

Event organizers will gather information about participants that confirmed
their in-person assistance, regarding their financial needs to cover the travel
expenses.
A list of candidates will be built after this information.

Software Underground could provide the fundings for covering beneficiaries'
costs in advance, and/or through reimbursement.
Beneficiaries will be required to provide tickets, bills and proof of payment
for the expenses covered by this financial aid.
These expenses will be reviewed by the event organizers and by Software
Underground Board, and ultimately approved for reimbursement.

Beneficiaries can choose to remain anonymous to the general public and Software
Underground community.
They can opt-out of being mentioned as beneficiaries in any public release of
the event, social media publication and blog post.
In such case, they will have to accept to be knowledgeable **only** by event
organizers and Software Underground Board Members.

After the event, beneficiaries will be encouraged to write some blog post
commenting their experience on the workshop.
These blog posts will have to be licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution
license and will be published on Software Underground website.
Beneficiaries can choose to remain anonymous in these blog posts.
